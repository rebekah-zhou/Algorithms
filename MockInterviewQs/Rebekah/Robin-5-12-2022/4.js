// Question: Design Question. Design tic tac toe. 

// Initial Thoughts Player moves 
const arr = [
    ['x', 'x', 'o'], 
    [null, null, null],
    [null, 'o', null]
]

// Assignment of "X" or "O" to player
// Decide who goes first
// Reset board if need be
// Player 1 makes a move, then Player 2, etc until ...
// There is 3 in a row of matching symbols 
// After every move, there is a check for a win. 
// Game ends when there is a win and congratulates the player who last moved.
// Otherwise, when the board is filled and there is no win, we declare a cat's game and end.
// Ask for replay.

// Board 
// Players 
// Logic how win is determined
